It has three to six times the activity of labetalol at the Beta-receptor, but unlike labetalol, little activity at the Alpha 1-receptor. In animal studies, it causes vasodilation even in denervated limbs, which is blocked by propranolol, suggesting that these vasodilator effects are due to Beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonism. It lowers blood pressure, both in normal and hypertensive subjects. Because the fall in blood pressure correlates with a fall in peripheral vascular resistance rather than a decrease in cardiac index, it is thought to be due to the Beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist induced vasodilation, rather than to non-specific, Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist effects.",,,,DILEVALOL HYDROCHLORIDE,CHEMBL1204165,4,0,1,MOL,,Small molecule,1990,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1984,-2,#NAME?,0,#NAME?,combined alpha and beta blockers,Anti-Adrenergic (beta-receptor); Antihypertensive,1,0,0,"InChI=1S/C19H24N2O3.ClH/c1-13(7-8-14-5-3-2-4-6-14)21-12-18(23)15-9-10-17(22)16(11-15)19(20)24;/h2-6,9-11,13,18,21-23H,7-8,12H2,1H3,(H2,20,24);1H/t13-,18+;/m1./s1",WQVZLXWQESQGIF-WJKBNZMCSA-N,C[C@H](CCc1ccccc1)NC[C@H](O)c1ccc(O)c(C(N)=O)c1.Cl,0.578521006,4,364.873,2.5572,4,4,2,95.58,-2.543097917,0.884696114,-5.614738964,0.989773047,-12.06279292,0.325820917,0.290241888,0.265435648,70.6870743,1.193878581,0.313836589,0.102783203,0.030485438,0.84138943,0.087618716,12.32576788,19.42110202,-0.326703179,2.51492258,0.452402821,0.448839533,0.309729978,0.043982794,0.670852423,0.028991057,0.020552315,0.090815634,0.020775475,0.022559829,0.008128894,0.004655028,0.00230501,0.020685711,0.037373042,0.007860492,0.334284744,FALSE,-7.333,2.906091299

This pyrazoloid structure imparts a significant increase in potency to the molecule and results in unusual two-site binding kinetics with the glucocorticoid receptor. Cortivazol induces the nuclear translocation and transactivation function of the glucocorticoid receptor, but not of the mineralocorticoid receptor.",Cortivazol has high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (10–20 times greater affinity for the GR than dexamethasone),"Cortivazol binds to the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytosol from CEM C7 cells (a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia line) in a fashion consistent with interaction with at least two sites. In mutant leukemia cells derived from CEM C7, resistant to kill by 10-4 M dexamethasone and deficient in standard glucocorticoid binding sites, cortivazol still finds a binding site and kills the cells. In wild-type leukemia cells, the binding sites of cortivazol, those with both higher (Kd ~5 x 10-10 M) and lower (Kd ~1 X 10-8 M) affinity appear to be on forms of the glucocorticoid receptor itself, and not on two different classes of molecules.

It acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction by inhibiting or interfering with the release and/or distribution of norepinephrine (NE), rather than acting at the effector cell by inhibiting the association of norepinephrine with its receptors. It is taken up by norepinephrine transporters. It becomes concentrated in NE transmitter vesicles, replacing NE in these vesicles. This leads to a gradual depletion of NE stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to arrival of an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, debrisoquin suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, debrisoquin lowers blood pressure in the supine position. It further reduces blood pressure by decreasing the degree of vasoconstriction that normally results from reflex sympathetic nervous activity upon assumption of the upright posture, thus reducing venous return and cardiac output more.",,,,DEBRISOQUIN,CHEMBL169901,4,1,0,MOL,34665,Small molecule,,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1965,-1,,0,,,Antihypertensive,0,0,0,"InChI=1S/C10H13N3/c11-10(12)13-6-5-8-3-1-2-4-9(8)7-13/h1-4H,5-7H2,(H3,11,12)",JWPGJSVJDAJRLW-UHFFFAOYSA-N,N=C(N)N1CCc2ccccc2C1,0.455159188,4,175.235,0.93817,1,2,0,53.11,-0.682567672,0.783054125,-5.268741736,0.993713892,-10.33288852,0.579029807,0.010209624,0.910890996,20.22912387,-5.968849934,0.028180854,0.018263858,0.000613007,0.306307703,0.000999174,-19.55299853,-0.019493362,-9.779533913,2.517496864,0.266770853,0.04588514,0.022554626,0.030756364,0.07990932,0.024313941,0.002727909,0.128167138,0.008676173,0.027303763,0.000303478,0.000188324,0.000626235,0.002696281,0.000762635,0.000776413,0.744902039,FALSE,-7.629,2.046352016
